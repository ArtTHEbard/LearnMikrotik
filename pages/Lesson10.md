## Advanced Topic 2: VLANS & HTTPS Proxies
VLANS and HTTPS proxies are network tools that can be implemented to further segregate and partition your network for various tasks.
As networks grow larger and add more users and functions, seperation within the network becomes more and more important.

### VLANS
VLANS (Virtual Local Area Networks) are solutions for craeting a seperated network if your company is utilizing a seperate network switch.
Documentation about configuring VLANS is specific to the type and brand of switch being utilized by your network, so only the Mikrotik configuration details will be covered in this guide.
