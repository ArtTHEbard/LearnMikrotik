In this video Sam will be going over logging and filtering. He will be demonstrating how to create a firewall rule that will allow you to filter and monitor indiviudal devices on your network. This video is more open ended with an example of one way to set filters and logs. The technique shown can be used in a variety of ways and we hope you take the time to explore the possibilities for logging and filtering your network. We suggest that the logging and filtering rules be tested as you can quickly create a very large amount of data.
